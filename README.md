There are four tabs: **1.)** A how-to-fill example tab (filled in Brazilian Portuguese language and scraping groups in the health area); **2.)** An Input tab, where you must paste your search and fill in the necessary information; **3.)** A Process tab, where you can see the text organization mechanism working; **4.)** An Output tab, where you can visualize and extract your data organized in alphabetical order.

## Run the Script (3 easy steps!)

**01.)** Open your Facebook, be logged into your account, search for which groups you want to extract, and select everything, as shown in the image below. After selecting all the groups, copy the data (possible with Ctrl+C ):

**02.)** Simply paste the content (possible with Ctrl+V) in the place indicated for "paste it", in the Input tab:

**03.)** Still on the Input tab, don't forget to include the "Index". In the case of the example in Portuguese, the term is "Participar", which means to participate in the group. You may see the term, "join", "get in", or others. Check the default term and add the place indicated in red. In addition, also check the pattern of terms for temporal parameters, being day, week, month and year, in addition to the word "posts", which in the case of Portuguese is "publicações". Attention, this configuration is very important so that your script can organize the terms well:
